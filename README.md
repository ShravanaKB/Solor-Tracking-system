# Solor-Tracking-system

## Description
This project implements an automatic solar tracking system that adjusts the position of a solar panel to face the direction of maximum sunlight. By continuously tracking the sun’s movement, the system improves energy efficiency compared to a fixed solar panel setup.

## Objective
- To increase solar energy capture using an automated tracking mechanism
- To reduce manual intervention in panel alignment

## Components Used
- Microcontroller-Arduino
- LDR sensors
- Servo motor 
- Solar panel
- Power supply
- Lipo Battery Charer Module
- DC to DC step up boost modue

## Working Principle
LDR sensors are placed on different sides of the solar panel to detect light intensity. The microcontroller continuously compares the sensor values and rotates the motor in the direction of higher light intensity. This ensures the solar panel remains aligned with the sun throughout the day.

## Features
- Automatic sunlight tracking
- Improved power efficiency
- Real-time sensor-based control
- Low power consumption

## Applications
- Solar power plants
- Rooftop solar systems
- Renewable energy projects
